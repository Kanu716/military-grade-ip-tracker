## üì¶ **Installation & Setup**

Follow these steps to integrate **Full Visitor Intel** into your website:

Sure! Here's the **step-by-step guide** written specifically for your README.md file:

---

## üì¶ **Installation and Setup**

### Step 1: **Download the `index.php` File**

* Download the `index.php` file that contains the Full Visitor Intel tracking script.
* This file will handle the collection of visitor information, including IP address, user-agent, geolocation, device details, etc.

### Step 2: **Upload the `index.php` File**

* **Log in to your hosting account** and access the **cPanel** or use an **FTP client**.
* **Navigate to the root directory** (usually `public_html` or your domain's main directory).
* **Upload** the `index.php` file to this directory.

### Step 3: **Ensure PHP Compatibility**

* Verify that your server supports **PHP** by creating a `phpinfo.php` file with the following content:

  ```php
  <?php phpinfo(); ?>
  ```

* Upload the `phpinfo.php` file to the same directory and access it via `http://yourdomain.com/phpinfo.php` to confirm that PHP is running.

### Step 4: **Check File Permissions**

* If you're logging visitor data to a file (e.g., `visitor_log.txt`), make sure the file is **writable** by the web server.
* In **cPanel** or **FTP**, right-click on `visitor_log.txt` and set its permissions to **644** (or **666** if necessary).

### Step 5: **Test the Script**

* Once uploaded, open your web browser and go to `http://yourdomain.com/index.php`.
* You should see a success message: **"Visitor data logged successfully."**
* Check the `visitor_log.txt` file or your database to verify that data is being captured.

### Step 6: **Configure Logging (Optional)**

* By default, the script logs data to a text file (`visitor_log.txt`), but you can modify it to log to a **database**.
* If you're using **MySQL**, configure the script to insert data into your database instead of logging to a file.

### Step 7: **Secure the Log File (Optional)**

* To prevent unauthorized access to the log file, create a `.htaccess` file in the same directory as `visitor_log.txt`:

  ```plaintext
  # Prevent access to log files
  <Files "visitor_log.txt">
  Order Allow,Deny
  Deny from all
  </Files>
  ```

### Step 8: **Monitor and Analyze Data**

* Once set up, monitor the visitor data being logged.
* Analyze data such as visitor IP addresses, device types, browsers, and geolocations.
